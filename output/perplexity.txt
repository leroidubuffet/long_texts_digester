# SUMMARY:

This conversation between Lex Fridman and Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity, dives into the technical and philosophical aspects of search engines, large language models (LLMs), and the future of AI-driven knowledge retrieval. Aravind explains the functionality behind **Perplexity**, a platform that merges traditional search with LLMs to create a tool more focused on answering queries with citations and reducing hallucinations, mimicking a well-sourced academic paper. Aravind hones in on **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)** — using retrieved documents as the source for generating facts instead of non-verified synthesis. This additional verification ensures that AI doesn’t hallucinate information and that results are precise and factual.

Throughout the podcast, Aravind outlines the fundamental principles of search, explaining Google’s and Perplexity's differing models. He emphasizes that his company's mission goes beyond traditional search engines, aiming to encourage **knowledge discovery** and satisfy human curiosity by fostering truth-seeking behaviors.

# TOOL:

### **How Perplexity Works:**
Perplexity is designed as a blend of both **search engines and large language models (LLMs)**. Its core architecture incorporates **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)** — combining traditional search methodology with LLM-generated output that strictly cites sources for better reliability.

1. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):**
   The starting point of Perplexity is traditional search, where the tool **retrieves relevant documents** from the web. Distinctively, it gathers these results, segments them as **paragraphs**, and feeds those sections to its LLMs. This retrieval layer improves by adding **fact-based context**, which is then used in crafting answers. Each statement made by the model **ties back to the information sourced from its selected citations.**

2. **The Integration with LLMs:**
   After the retrieval stage, the LLM is tasked with **assembling a cohesive response** based on these cited documents. Aravind explains that this design offers a critical point of differentiation. Traditional search engines may return links, but Perplexity compiles the knowledge extracted from multiple verified documents and structures it into an intelligible response, much in the same way an **academic writes a well-sourced paper**.

3. **Preventing Hallucinations:**
   One hazard with other LLMs is their tendency to hallucinate by producing facts that are not grounded in verified data, especially when the LLM guesses based on incomplete or ambiguous input. **Perplexity avoids hallucinating by sticking strictly to the factual information retrieved from web documents**, thus reducing the chance that the model will generate incorrect or fabricated responses. If not enough information is available from its retrieval process, the model is trained to present fallback responses such as, “We don’t have the information to fully answer.”

4. **Citation Mechanism:**
   Every statement made through Perplexity’s LLM has **citations attached**, which is designed to increase reliability and trustworthiness. Aravind noted that this updating mechanism mimicked **Wikipedia’s rules around notability** and academic citations which ensures a strict factual adherence.

5. **Indexing and Crawling:**
   Perplexity uses a crawler, similar to **Googlebot**, called PerplexityBot. The crawling involved not just **scraping pages from the web** but rendering JavaScript-heavy modern websites, identifying useful information, and respecting the site’s policies like **robots.txt**, which dictate what may be indexed.

   The **indexing process** involves organizing data based on importance to produce pages that are searchable by the system's algorithms. It utilizes **BM25**, a modified version of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), as a primary technology for indexing results. This ensures that the search engine picks up on relevant information from web pages efficiently.

6. **Vector Embeddings vs. Traditional Retrieval:**
   The system does not entirely depend on novel **machine-learning vector systems** to rank results. Methods like **BM25/tf-idf** often perform better than embeddings, which might not always rank results correctly. The system integrates general term-frequency-based retrieval with **vector space embeddings** to prioritize high-relevance documents in a hybrid fashion. BM25 scores ensure traditional models maintain a strong showing of relevance to people’s queries while embeddings help connect related terms in context.

7. **Optimizing for Low-Latency Performance:**
   Perplexity heavily tracks two core latency factors — **Time to First Token (TTFT)** and throughput — which are carefully monitored to optimize server performance. Aravind explains how leveraging **NVIDIA’s TensorRT-LLM** libraries for **in-house models** and keeping in tune with providers like OpenAI and AWS have made this aspect scalable. This is important for providing a seamless user experience, especially during high-traffic usage.

8. **Scalability and Cloud-Based Compute:**
   Currently, Perplexity relies heavily on **cloud infrastructure (AWS)**, ensuring fast scaling during spikes and providing flexible GPU capacity when necessary. Running models locally for efficiency, training custom models like **Sonar (based on Llama 3)**, and prioritizing inference speeds further cement its high-speed output. Cloud-native operations allow for scalability, but important decisions about whether to continue using vast external resources or to invest in their own data centers loom as Perplexity grows.

# AI & ML:

### Key Concepts Across AI, ML, and LLMs:

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
   RAG is central to Perplexity’s design, incorporating AI to both search for relevant documents and generate synthesized output based on retrieved documents. The goal of the system is to ground AI generations in factual sources to defeat hallucinations.

2. **Advances in Natural Language Understanding:**
   Aravind emphasized the **longer context windows** allowing LLM-based systems to hold more meaningful and extensive conversations, possibly answering complex queries over thousands of tokens. Memory mechanisms and context windows are particularly crucial in aiding the model to reason more deeply.

3. **Attention Mechanisms in Transformers:**
   **Self-attention and transformers** have revolutionized AI by allowing parallelization during training. Transformer's ability to learn higher-order dependencies between not only adjacent words but across a wide span of tokens fuels the transformer-based architecture of LLMs like GPT.

4. **LLMs and Scaling Laws:**
   Scaling laws in AI dictate that **larger models trained on more data** tend to perform better. As noted by Aravind, scaling from GPT-2 to GPT-3 (from 1 billion to 175 billion parameters) exponentially improved capabilities, such as composing coherent stories, generating factual trivia, and creative reasoning. He argues that data cleaning (de-duplication of sources) and better querying methods will dominate future releases of LLM models.

5. **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback):**
   This technique is described as "post-training" or fine-tuning of a model, ensuring not just that it can predict the next word but also follow "desired behaviors." It helps improve outputs in conversational scenarios making the system **controllable, coherent, and context-aware** while correcting misleading predictions.

6. **AI Systems Improving Reasoning Capabilities:**
   The pathway to **AGI discovery** involves decoupling the **reasoning abilities** from the factual knowledge base ingrained in models through self-training modules. Perplexity operates on leading-edge reasoning advancements through datasets and metric evaluations.

7. **Advanced Language Models (Sonar):**
   Perplexity’s **Sonar model**, built on **Llama 3**, is noted as a specialized post-trained LLM. It improves performance on specific tasks such as long-contact support, precise citation referencing, and better summarization, becoming a **tailor-made AI engine** for the product. This marks another layer of AI comprehension driven primarily by advances in summarization and citation-focused training.

8. **LLMs for Knowledge Discovery:**
   Perplexity’s mission is ultimately powered by **large scale generative models** fine-tuned specifically for quicker understanding in the discovery process. Features enabling real-time web search and **maintaining accuracy via tagged and cited documents** make it more practical for truth-seeking and **fact-centric knowledge generation**.
